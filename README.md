## Description

Ci-notifier is a GitHub [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) App to comment on pull requests when a commit from that PR fails continuous integration.

This app uses the [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) framework and [@Probot/serverless-lambda](https://github.com/probot/serverless-lambda). The production application is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)/[API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and is continuously deployed through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/RyanMillerC/ci-notifier) using the [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) Framework.

## Setup

To set up ci-notifier for your repo,

1. Enable ci-notifier for your repo [here](https://github.com/apps/ci-notifier).

That's it! Next time a commit fails your CI process, ci-notifier will comment with more info.
